Hurricane Sandy touched down in New York on October 29, 2012, and exposed the surprising fragility of New York Harbor’s fuel supply chain. 

The storm impacted nearly every link in the chain; foreign oil tankers were blocked by water debris, refineries closed due to flooding, pipelines and storage depots were halted due to power cuts, and emergency agencies commandeered tanker trucks. 

Lastly, power outages prevented the dispensing of fuel, and even for stations without outages, procuring scarce fuel was an uphill battle. 

Most companies were critically underprepared, but there were a few that took some proactive action. Fuel company Nustar with a terminal in Linden, New Jersey, raised barriers, or berms, around its tanks and elevated critical cables away from potential flooding areas.

However, most energy companies weren’t so prepared for the natural disaster and therefore weren’t so lucky. Reuters reported that Sandy’s surge led to water overflowing berms, even lifting partially full tanks off the ground, causing fuel spills. 

Coast Guard Commander Linda Sturgis told Reuters, "It takes considerable investment. Nobody thought, at the time, that they would need 15-foot berms.”
