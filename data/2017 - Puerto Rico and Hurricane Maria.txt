When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, the supply chains of two of the island’s biggest industries — pharmaceuticals and medical devices — were ravaged by the severity of the severe storms.
Authorities were tasked with ensuring critical drugs and medical supplies didn’t reach dangerous shortages, and the effects spread to the United States as well, as the storm knocked out many of the facilities that make sterile saline bags in Puerto Rico. 
As the United Nations reported, hospitals were forced to ration saline, with patients thousands of miles away from the hurricane feeling the effects of the supply chain disruption.
