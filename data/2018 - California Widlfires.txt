Human-caused disasters (or those often started by humans), like wildfires, can cause major economic losses and ruin a location’s infrastructure, affecting communities and supply chains. 
The wildfires that occurred in California in 2018 were caused by extreme drought, dryness, and poorly maintained power lines. The aftermath was $150 billion worth of damage, a loss of life throughout the state, and severe damage to buildings and nature.
Like other natural disasters, this can take a while to recover fully, especially when communities, companies, and factories must fully rebuild.
