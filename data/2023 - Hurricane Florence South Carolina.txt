As communities began to assess the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, supply chains struggled to catch up with the backlog of deliveries.
North Carolina’s Port of Morehead, which had to delay reopening for recovery efforts, and the Port of Wilmington resumed all commercial truck operations in September of 2023 after employees returned to work later in September.
Both locations saw significant damage to warehouses and other buildings, and numerous empty containers were downed.
Road and rail connections were affected as well, with the biggest trucking disruption along Interstate 95 through the Carolinas. With the exception of one 9-mile stretch, flooding kept most of I-95 in North Carolina shut down.
Meanwhile, the FDA kept a close eye on medical supplies and devices and assisted pharmacies in checking for potential contamination of medical devices. Any contaminated devices, such as glucose meters and digital thermometers, would have posed serious safety and health risks.
Other industries that were impacted included the automotive, agriculture, textiles, and manufacturing sectors, as well as retail and North Carolina’s up-and-coming biotech industry.
